        <h2>Reading</h2>
        <p>Developed the interest in reading novel at 16 years old, which is during the PKP times since we had a lot of hours at home and thought that it is a good hobby to keep. However, until now it is very hard to consistently reading, since now I also had to juggle the times with doing assignment and running between classes, it's very hard to read even a book yet the interest in reading has never gave out. Reading a book in a month isn't that many but still a small step to keep the spirit up.</p>

        <h2>Journaling</h2>
        <p>This hobby comes after the phase of reading which is stilled in the PKP time. I found it interesting because we can jotted down our thoughts and what we did. To make it interesting, we can also put some stickers or printed elements. As a visual learner, I really like it and sometimes also made my notes for studying like journaling so that I understand the topic better.</p>

        <h2>Watching movie at late night</h2>
        <p>This hobby starts with romcom movies which I opted for since the first semester of my university life as a way to unwind after long study sessions. Over time, my interest expanded to include other genres like drama, mystery, and even documentaries, making late-night movie marathons a cherished part of my routine. My favourite movie are many, but the classic like Mean Girls, The Parent Trap, Legally Blonde will be remember. I even have the list of it.</p>

        <h2>Cafe hunting</h2>
        <p>Going for a cafe is also a way for me to unwind myself from the stress of doing assignments and reward myself with some sweet treats. Exploring different cafes not only helps me relax but also allows me to discover new flavors, unique interior designs, and inspiring atmospheres that spark creativity and refresh my mind. Recently, I have went to Chloe.co cafe in Ipoh and Baeshake cafe in Bertam.</p>

        <h2>Shopping for clothes</h2>
        <p>After going to university, my interest in fashion grew and I started surveying for brands and qualities that suit me the best. Then, whenever I have enough money, I buy them occasionally. This hobby has become a way for me to express myself and boost my confidence. Over time, Iâ€™ve developed a keen eye for styles that reflect my personality while staying within my budget.</p>
